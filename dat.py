# Python3 program to print 
# primes smaller than n using
# Sieve of Sundaram.

# Prints all prime numbers smaller
def SieveOfSundaram(n):
	
	# In general Sieve of Sundaram, 
	# produces primes smaller
	# than (2*x + 2) for a number 
	# given number x. Since we want
	# primes smaller than n, we 
	# reduce n to half
	nNew = int((n - 1) / 2);

	# This array is used to separate 
	# numbers of the form i+j+2ij
	# from others where 1 <= i <= j
	# Initialize all elements as not marked
	marked = [0] * (nNew + 1);

	# Main logic of Sundaram. Mark all 
	# numbers of the form i + j + 2ij 
	# as true where 1 <= i <= j
	for i in range(1, nNew + 1):
		j = i;
		while((i + j + 2 * i * j) <= nNew):
			marked[i + j + 2 * i * j] = 1;
			j += 1;

	# Since 2 is a prime number
	if (n > 2):
		print(2, end = " ")

	# Print other primes. Remaining 
	# primes are of the form 2*i + 1 
	# such that marked[i] is false.
	for i in range(1, nNew + 1):
		if (marked[i] == 0):
			print((2 * i + 1), end = " ")
